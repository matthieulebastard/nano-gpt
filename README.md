# Nano GPT project

This project was developed as part of the **"Machine Learning" tutorial series** on [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/practice), starting from module 10, and following the tutorials by **Dev G**.

A demo notebook and the corrected version of the exercises can be accessed here:

## Current Features

- The model currently works with a **pre-trained dataset** based on **Drake lyrics**.
- Implements key concepts from **linear regression to Transformer architectures**, culminating in a **mini GPT model**.

## Resources

- **Neetcode Machine Learning Problems**: [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/practice)
- **YouTube Channel by Dev G**: [GPT Learning Hub](https://www.youtube.com/@gptLearningHub)

## Future improvement ideas
- Adding the training functions, to make the model generate other things than Drake Lyrics
- Bug corrections (output currently limited to 128 chars)


Feel free to explore the code, run and provide any feedback !
